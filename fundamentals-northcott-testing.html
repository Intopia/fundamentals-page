            <p>The videos below provide a short overview of key accessibility topics that will help you understand the value of accessibility. Please make sure to watch these videos before attending your first training session.</p>

            <h2>What is web accessibility?</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8N6iwkc2LU" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h2>Accessibility in practice</h2>

            <h2>Principles and standards</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S83Pi_IfG-M" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h2>Use without vision</h2>
            <p>The next video talks about technology use for people without  vision. This video runs for about 5 and a half minutes.</p>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hf02tw8wBJA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h3>Self-paced activity: screen readers</h3>
            <p>Narrator is a screen-reading app that's built into Windows 10, so there's nothing you need to download or install so we are going to use it for this activity.</p>
            <p>However, Narrator is generally the least-used compared with the two other PC screen readers, JAWS and NVDA. NVDA is free and open source so we encourage you to download and install (and donate to them as a not-for-profit).</p>
            <p>Let's get started. Be aware that screen readers can be a bit hard the first time you use them. Take your time, and let us know if you are stuggling.</p>
            <h4>Starting Narrator</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Press the Windows logo key  + Ctrl + Enter together to start Narrator. Press these keys again to stop Narrator. (On older versions of Windows, the command was the Windows logo key  + Enter.) On many keyboards, the Windows logo key is located on the bottom row of keys, to the left or right of the Alt key.</li>
              <li>Press the Windows logo key  + Ctrl + N to open Narrator settings, and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Read through content linearly</h4>
            <p>Screen reader users may start by reading through content linearly, although they won’t always do that.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the down arrow to read the next item on the page.</li>
	            <li>Use the up arrow to read the previous item on the page.</li>
            </ul>
            What to listen for:
            <ul>
              <li>All content that is visible onscreen is announced.</li>
              <li>Content that is not visible onscreen is not announced. </li>
              <li>They type of content, such as ‘heading’ or ‘button’ is announced.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Use with limited vision</h2>
            <p>The next video talks about technology use for people with limited vision. This video runs for about 5 minutes.</p>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jeDASY2e5RA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h3>Self-paced activity: screen magnifier</h3>
            <p>Windows and Mac both come with a built-in screen magnifier. On Windows, it is is called the Windows Screen Magnifier. On Mac, it is called Zoom. Let's turn it on and have a play.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Open the <a href="">Northcott</a> homepage.</li>
              <li>Turn on screen magnification (see instructions below) and set to 400% magnification. If you are using a dual screen, we recommend you switch to a single screen for this activity.</li>
              <li>Complete these two tasks with the magnifier on
                <ul>
                  <li>Find a Northcott Service Centre near Parramatta.</li>
                  <li>As a member, find the login form (you don't have to log in).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>When we do activities like this, we need to remember we are not our user. So, what we experience is not going to be the same as what a native screen magnifier user might experience.</p>
            <p>It is a good way to get a bit more understanding of the technology, and conceptually think about what issues screen magnifier user's might experience.</p>
            
            <p>In Slack, post what difficulties a screen magnifier user might experience based on your experience using a screen magnifier and completing the two tasks above.</p>
            
            <h4>How to turn on Windows screen magnifier</h4>
          
            <ol>
              <li>Press the Windows logo key  + Plus sign (+) on the keyboard to turn Magnifier on.</li>
              <li>Increase the magnification to 400% and browse the page you are on.</li>
              <li>Press Windows logo key  + Esc to turn Magnifier off.</li>
            </ol>            
            <h4>How to turn on Zoom in OSX</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Navigate to System Preferences. This can be accessed through the Apple menu in the top left-corner, or by typing "System Preferences" in Spotlight.</li>
              <li>Select Accessibility.</li>
              <li>Select Zoom from the Vision menu on the left.
                <ul>
                  <li>Select Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom, if you'd like to use your keyboard to control the Zoom functions.</li>
                  <li>Select Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom, if you'd like to use your keyboard in combination a mouse or trackpad to zoom in and out.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Zoom in until you can only see approximately one sixteenth of the screen (which is about 400%).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Self-paced activity: high contrast</h3>
            <p>Take a look at this short 1-minute video about customisable text.</p>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbiI65Jcz5s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>One way a person with limited vision may customise their interface is to use a high contrast colour theme.</p>
            <p>This activity requires you to be on a Windows machine. Mac does have high contrast, but it works in a slightly different way. If you don’t have a Windows machine, skip this activity.</p>
            <p>To turn high contrast mode on and off in Windows:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Select the Start   button, then select Settings  > Ease of Access > High contrast.</li>
              <li>Turn on the toggle under Turn on high contrast. It will default to High Contrast theme #1, but you can change to any theme. When you're done, select Apply.</li>
              <li>To turn off high contrast mode, switch off the toggle under Turn on high contrast.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When you turned on high contrast, did you notice the different colours for text, hyperlinks, disabled text, selected text, button text and background colour?</p>
            <p>With these colours in mind, navigate to a website or software of your choice and check that the theme has applied fully to all elements on the page.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest problems for high contrast and other customisations is images of text – that is, text that is embedded in images. Images of text cannot be customised at all.</p>
            <p>Find something that doesn’t quite work? Post about it in Slack, and if it is in a closed environment upload a screenshot.</p>

              
            <h2>Use with limited colour perception</h2>
            <p>The next video talks about technology use for people with limited colour perception. You may know this as colour-blindness. This video runs for about 3 and a half minutes.</p>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xPxU74nv4N8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h3>Self-paced activity: limited colour perception</h3>
            <p>Chrome has a DevTools feature can emulate blurred vision and the following types of limited colour perception:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Protanopia: the inability to perceive any red light.</li>
              <li>Deuteranopia: the inability to perceive any green light.</li>
              <li>Tritanopia: the inability to perceive any blue light.</li>
              <li>Achromatopsia: the inability to perceive any colour except for shades of grey, which is rare.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, turn on the emulate colour vision deficiency option in Chrome.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Open Chrome DevTools.
                <ul>
                  <li>Windows – Press F12, or right-click on the page and select the Inspect option.</li>
                  <li>Mac – Press Command + Option+ I, or right-click or option-click on the page and select the Inspect option.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Open the Command Menu 
                <ul>
                  <li>Windows – use Control + Shift + P to open the Command Menu.</li>
                  <li>Mac - Use Cmd + Shift + P to open the Command Menu.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Search for ‘Show rendering’ in the Command Menu and select Enter.</li>
              <li>Scroll down until you find the Emulate vision deficiencies dropdown and select one of the colour deficiency options: protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia or achromatopsia.</li>
            </ol>     
            <p>Open Transport for London’s <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/version-a-185x140mm-december-2020a.pdf">transport map (PDF)</a> in Chrome and make sure you have the colour deficiency emulated set to ‘Achromatopsia’.</p>
            <p>Notice how all the information in the map cannot be understood without full colour perception? Change the colour settings to Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia to emulate other colour perception conditions.</p>
            <p>Now take a look at Transport for London’s <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/bw-large-print-map.pdf">transport map for colour blind customers (PDF)</a>. What do you notice?</p>
           
            <h2>Use with no or limited hearing</h2>
            <p>The next video talks about technology use for people with no or limited hearing. This video runs for about 4 minutes.</p>
            <p>If you haven’t been watching the previous videos with captions turned on, now is the time to turn your captions on so you can experience them.</p>
            <p>To turn on closed captions in YouTube:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Play the YouTube video so that the media player controls at the bottom of the player appear.</li>
              <li>Select the <strong>CC button</strong> on the media player controls to turn closed captions on.</li>
            </ul>
